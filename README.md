# SIGMA
### For the hell of it.

## Just ***WHY***?

In my journey around the internets, I heard of thingies called ropes, and their
benefits over character array strings, and wanted to see if I could make something that used them.

## Yea. Okay. But you've never finished anything...

I know. I might not finish this, but at least I put something down, something concrete,
rather than let it float around in the frothy mess of my mind, forever unknown.

## Welp. Here we are. So, just what is this?

My wonderful, rainbow-filled attempt at a scripting language! So many attempts...
Anyways, I want it to focus on 3 things:

- Algebraically Defined Types
- Trait-based Generics
- Ropes
- Fibers and Cooperative Scheduling

### Algebraically Defined Types

I first saw these in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and started using them in
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org). Fell. In. Love. After using C++ and their enums,
the ADTs were like a gift that fell from the sky.

But I have no clue how to implement. :cry:

### Trait-based Generics

Completely from Rust, with an interesting twist: methods can ONLY be defined on traits.

### Ropes

TBW

### Fibers and Cooperative Scheduling
